# Fire-Proximity-Prompt
The first instance of a function which could automatically fire a proximity prompt without any use of Virtual Input Manager or any Virtual User related methods. This didn't take me too long, just a 5 minute review of the api surrounding proximity prompts and then another 5 minutes testing how they work. This function could also skip the time it takes for the proximity prompt to fire but this can be detected so there is an option to disable it.
